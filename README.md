## Introducing instance label correlation in multiple instance learning. Application to cancer detection on histopathological images

This is the implementation for VGPMIL-PR-I proposed in our paper. Please see the class `vgpmil_probit_smooth` (https://github.com/pablomorales92/vgpmil_pr_i/blob/1b3aabae4c8ab2cd4e2aa08cdc8d9c57f8e3123a/vgpmil_probit_smooth.py#L38C7-L38C27), where the definition of each input is provided.
